            <p>Hello everyone, my name is William LaMonte Golden. Please call me LaMonte (pronounced le mont).
            </p>

                <p>This is my second quarter at Seattle Central in the Web Design program. I livestream bands from the Owl N Thistle Irish Pub in Pioneer Square. I want to combine my experience in audio video production with Web Design.</p>
                
                <p>Iâ€™m an Illinois transplant and a huge Seahawks & Husky fan. Bring back the Sonics.

                <p>I've been surrounded by musicians my entire life and I was introduced to all sorts of instruments growing up but never applied myself. After many years of letting my bass gather dust. I decided to pick up it and see what I could play. Lucky for me I still have lots of musicians who call me friend and give me free lessons. Now I play bass as much as I can for fun & have been asked to sit in with some friends which is a true honor. </p>
